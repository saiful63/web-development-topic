visibility:hidden hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout. display:none removes the element from the document. It does not take up any space.


So, the difference between display: “none”; and visibility: “hidden”; right from the name itself we can tell the difference as display: “none”; completely gets rids of the tag, as it had never existed in the HTML page whereas visibility: “hidden”; just makes the tag invisible, it will still on the HTML page occupying space it’s just invisible.

Both of the cannot remove element from dom.html:

 <div class="container">
    <div class="fr">

    </div>
    <div class="sc">
      
    </div>
    <div class="th">
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  
  css:
  
   .container{
    width: 100%;
  }
  .fr,.sc,.th{
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    
  }

  .fr{
    background-color: red;
  }

  .sc{
    background-color: blue;
    visibility: hidden;
    display: none;
  }

  .th{
    background-color: green;
  }
