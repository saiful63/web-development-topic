Microdata is part of the WHATWG HTML Standard and is used to nest metadata within existing content on web pages. Search engines and web crawlers can extract and process microdata from a web page and use it to provide a richer browsing experience for users. Search engines benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data because it allows search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide more relevant results to users. Microdata uses a supporting vocabulary to describe an item and name-value pairs to assign values to its properties.

At a high level, microdata consists of a group of name-value pairs. The groups are called items, and each name-value pair is a property. Items and properties are represented by regular elements.

    *To create an item, the itemscope attribute is used.
    *To add a property to an item, the itemprop attribute is used on one of the item's descendants.
    *itemtype â€“ Specifies the URL of the vocabulary that will be used to define itemprop's (item properties) in the data structure
    
#Vocabularies:

Google and other major search engines support the Schema.org vocabulary for structured data.    

Microdata vocabularies provide the semantics or meaning of an Item. Web developers can design a custom vocabulary or use vocabularies available on the web, such as the widely used schema.org vocabulary. A collection of commonly used markup vocabularies are provided by Schema.org.


#Example:

 <section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Restaurant">
   <div itemprop="menu">
    <h1>Restaurant</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Birani house</li>
      <li>Juicrs</li>
      <li>ThaiBan</li>
    </ul>
   </div>
  </section>
  
  in the above example ,it is specified that we have used Restaurant url "https://schema.org/Restaurant" to add restaurant related property .Here itemproperty="menu" understands the serach engine that we have listed down some restaurant name here.
